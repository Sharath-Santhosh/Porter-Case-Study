# Porter-Case-Study

(Neural Networks, Regression, Feature Engineering, Evaluation Metrics)

This project aims to build a machine learning model for estimating delivery times at Porter. The goal is to improve customer satisfaction by providing reliable delivery estimates and optimize logistics operations.The model will help Porter enhance operational efficiency and improve service delivery.

Key concepts applied in this project include:
- **Neural Networks**
- **Regression Modeling** for delivery time estimation
- **Feature Engineering** to extract meaningful insights from the data
- **Evaluation Metrics** to assess model performance and accuracy
