# Porter-Case-Study

(Neural Networks, Regression, Feature Engineering, Evaluation Metrics)

Porter, India's largest marketplace for intra-city logistics, wants to provide accurate delivery time estimates for its food delivery service. Ensuring timely deliveries is essential for customer satisfaction.

This project aims to build a machine learning model for estimating delivery times at Porter. The goal is to improve customer satisfaction by providing reliable delivery estimates and optimize logistics operations.


Key concepts applied in this project include:
- **Neural Networks**
- **Regression Modeling** for delivery time estimation
- **Feature Engineering** to extract meaningful insights from the data
- **Evaluation Metrics** to assess model performance and accuracy
